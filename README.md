The current project I am working on is creating a website using HTML which contains the information for basic recipes.

The skills I would have demonstrated on completion include knowing how to code an HMTL boilerplate and utilise a variety of different HTML elements with tags such as header tags, unordered and ordered lists and the utilisation of image tags.
